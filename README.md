# ClimateCrisis

Climate Crisis, is a variable font designed to help visualise the urgency of climate change. Commissioned by TBWA\Helsinki for Helsingin Sanomat, the largest Nordic newspaper. The typefaceâ€™s weight responds to the levels of Arctic sea ice from 1979 to 2019 and predictions for 2050, based on data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Published as an open source project, it is available for free, hopefully through use it can raise awareness and invoke a call for action.
